- How Strong is your memory - 
well test out and see your score and see if you can find all the matching cards.
This is a Simple mind game that can fill in your time when bored and can also pass over to your friends.

# What I would improve
- A timer to count the amount of time the puzzle was finished
- A user input to track down scores, time, and a leaderbord
- Puzzle levels and diffaculty (the more challenging the more fun)
- Different card decks to chelleng the memory and for visual fun.
